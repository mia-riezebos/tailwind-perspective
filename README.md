# tailwind-perspective

I was a little disappointed that tailwind didn't natively support 3d transforms, so I took it upon myself to extend that functionality with this plugin

## Installation

```
pnpm i -D tailwind-perspective
```
```
yarn add -D tailwind-perspective
```
```
npm i -D tailwind-perspective
```

## Usage

Please note that all utilities from tailwind-perspective are prefixed with `twp-`.
Coming at some point (busy with big projects)
